# Environmental Health Analysis: Exploring the Relationship Between Air Pollution (PM2.5) and Respiratory Health outcomes in Nigeria (2018-2023)
## Abstract
Air pollution has become one of the most pressing public health challenged in Nigeria’s urban environments. Rapid urbanization, industrial activities, and increased vehicular movement have led to higher concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), raising the risk of respiratory health issues among people living in urban areas.
This project explores the relationship between ambient PM2.5 levels and respiratory disease outcomes across major Nigerian cities, following the methodology described in Obani (2025): *Air Pollution and Public Health– Examining the Correlation Between PM2.5 Levels and Respiratory Diseases in Major Cities in Nigeria.*

Using publicly available environmental and health datasets (2018–2023), the analysis explores how PM2.5 exposure correlates with the incidence of respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Statistical and visualization methods are used to identify links between pollution and health, highlight high-risk regions, and draw attention to vulnerable populations.


## Problem Statement & Objectives
Although global studies have established strong links between PM2.5 exposure and increased hospital visits or respiratory-related mortality, local data-driven research in Nigeria is still quite limited. This research seeks to answer:
**How does air pollution (PM2.5) correlate with respiratory disease prevalence in Nigeria’s urban centers between 2018 and 2023?**

It also examines which cities face the highest pollution–health burden, and whether factors like population size or seasonal variations (wet and dry seasons) influence the severity of these health outcomes.

### Objectives
- Analyze PM2.5 levels across major Nigerian cities between 2018 and 2023.
- Investigate their relationship with respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, and COPD.
- Identify regions with the highest combined pollution and health burden.
- Visualize findings using statistical plots and charts to communicate patterns and trends clearly.
